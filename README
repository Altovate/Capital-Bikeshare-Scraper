Capital Bikeshare (CABI) Usage Python Screen Scrapper

Re-purposed by Harlan Yu (@harlanyu) for Capital Bikeshare; 
code originally written by Justin Grimes (@justgrimes) & Josh Tauberer (@joshdata) for scraping WMATA data (https://github.com/justgrimes/WMATA-SmarTrip-Scraper)

Simple python script that scrapes a CABI user's transit usage data 
Script extracts data from HTML tables using Beautiful Soup library then writes lovely clean CSV files.

*IMPORTANT* To run this code, use python CABIscraper.py -u <username> -p <password>

Enjoy!
